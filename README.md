# tableau_retail_data
Dashboard that can help analyze the sales patterns across stores and their departments. 

## Two Controls:
1. A (Month, Year) filter.
2. A user control to select either one of the five markdowns or total markdown.
These controls should work across the entire dashboard. [10]
### Visualization 1
A dual-axis visualization showing sales & markdowns by week. It should be divided into three
parts, showing results by three store types – hypermarkets, discount stores, and
neighborhood stores. Sales during holiday weeks should be colored differently from sales
during non-holiday weeks. [20]
#### Visualization 2
A dual-axis visualization showing sales & markdowns by store. It should be divided into three
parts, showing results by three store types – hypermarkets, discount stores, and
neighborhood stores. [15]
Visualization 3
A visualization showing top 5 departments by sales within each store, within the three store
types. User should be able to see ‘Store Type’, ‘Store’, ‘Department’, ‘Store Sales’, and
‘Department Sales’ within the tooltip for each department. [30]
Two Action Filters:
1. Source: Visualization 1, Target: Visualization 2, Visualization 3.
2. Source: Visualization 2, Target: Visualization 3 [5]
Finally,  a story providing any three interesting insights drawn from visualizations in the
dashboard, while focusing your analysis around the four holiday weeks.
